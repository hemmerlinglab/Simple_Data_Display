# Simple Data Display

The idea of this program is to analyze the data from a csv file of the spectrum of potassium from an oscilloscope: 
* fit it to find the frequency width
* find and verify the frequency spacing between the different absorption lines
* verify against known potassium lines to figure out what the offset in our wavemeter is
--> however, with the absorption lines being so broad, we cannot get good resolution on the offset of the wavemeter
* find the cell emptying time --> how long it takes for the signal to be on resonance ** double check this
